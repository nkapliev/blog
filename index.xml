      <description>Q: I have stopped reporting some counters to graphite and removed folders/counters related to them. Why graphite recreates deleted folders/counters?
A: Most probably because some of your applications are still reporting removed counters. And graphite just doing what it suppose to do: storing them.
So, the first thing to do you should check that changes in your applications that prevent old counters from reporting have been deployed for real.
Go to instances/containers whith your application and check its source code.</description>

      <description>Once in the evening, Iâ€™ve been helping Google to save Bunny Planet.
My friend from India told me that forest pythons are extremely dangerous.
He said: Nick, you a good man, but your bear fighting skills that you developed during childhood in Russia will barely help you if you will meet such a big snake as a python in a forest.
So, I was looking for some docs about interaction with pythons: tips from masters, evidence of survivals.</description>
